# Mixed Reality AppService Demo
This sample demonstrates how to create a DeskTop Bridge version of a UWP Mixed Reality app that can launch a Win32 exe and communicate
between the UWP and Win32 apps via an AppSerice. The UWP Mixed Reality app will continue to run in the HMD while the Win32 exe will run on the
user's desktop. Both apps connect to an AppService so data may be exchanged between the 2 processes.

Note: This example will not work for the Hololens as it is not able to launch a Win32 application.
